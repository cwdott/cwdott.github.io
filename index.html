  <h1>25 Principles of Adult Behavior</h1>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Be patient. No matter what.</li>
      <li>Don’t badmouth: Assign responsibility, not blame. Say nothing of another you wouldn’t say to <!-- this said "him" but I changed it to "them" -->them.</li>
      <li>Never assume the motives of others are, to them, less noble than yours are to you.</li>
      <li>Expand your sense of the possible.</li>
      <li>Don’t trouble yourself with matters you truly cannot change.</li>
      <li>Expect no more of anyone than you can deliver yourself.</li>
      <li>Tolerate ambiguity.</li>
      <li>Laugh at yourself frequently.</li>
      <li>Concern yourself with what is right rather than who is right.</li>
      <li>Never forget that, no matter how certain, you might be wrong.</li>
      <li>Give up blood sports.</li>
      <li>Remember that your life belongs to others as well.</li>
      <li>Don’t risk it frivolously.</li>
      <li>Never lie to anyone for any reason. (Lies of omission are sometimes exempt.)</li>
      <li>Learn the needs of those around you and respect them.</li>
      <li>Avoid the pursuit of happiness.</li>
      <li>Seek to define your mission and pursue that.</li>
      <li>Reduce your use of the first personal pronoun.</li>
      <li>Praise at least as often as you disparage.</li>
      <li>Admit your errors freely and soon.</li>
      <li>Become less suspicious of joy.</li>
      <li>Understand humility.</li>
      <li>Remember that love forgives everything.</li>
      <li>Foster dignity.</li>
      <li>Live memorably.</li>
      <li>Love yourself.</li>
      <li>Endure.</li>
