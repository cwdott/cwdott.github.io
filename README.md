# cwdott.github.io

Pretty much, this GitHub Page will be used to test whatever flavour-of-the-day static page I'm working on.

## Methodology

I will be using branches off the main to have various possible pages in play. Not sure how this will expand to more than a single page, but we'll cross that bridge when we get there.

### Built With

All of these pages should be coded with the following technologies:

* [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS extension/metalanguage
* CSS3 - Latest version of CSS
* HTML5 - Latest version of HTML



```
