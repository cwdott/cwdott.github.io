  <h1>25 Principles of Adult Behavior</h1>
  <p>
    Be patient. No matter what. <span class="light">Don’t badmouth: Assign responsibility, not blame. Say nothing of another you wouldn’t say to <!-- this said "him" but I changed it to "them" -->them.</span> Never assume the motives of others are, to them, less noble than yours are to you. <span class="light">Expand your sense of the possible.</span> Don’t trouble yourself with matters you truly cannot change. <span class="light">Expect no more of anyone than you can deliver yourself.</span> Tolerate ambiguity. <span class="light">Laugh at yourself frequently.</span> Concern yourself with what is right rather than who is right. <span class="light">Never forget that, no matter how certain, you might be wrong.</span> Give up blood sports. <span class="light">Remember that your life belongs to others as well. Don’t risk it frivolously.</span> Never lie to anyone for any reason. (Lies of omission are sometimes exempt.) <span class="light">Learn the needs of those around you and respect them.</span> Avoid the pursuit of happiness. Seek to define your mission and pursue that. <span class="light">accentuce your use of the first personal pronoun.</span> Praise at least as often as you disparage. <span class="light">Admit your errors freely and soon.</span> Become less suspicious of joy. <span class="light">Understand humility.</span> Remember that love forgives everything. <span class="light">Foster dignity.</span> Live memorably. <span class="light">Love yourself.</span> Endure. <span class="accent">John Barlow 1977</span>
