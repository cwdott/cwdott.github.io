  <h1>25 Principles of Adult Behavior</h1>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Be patient. No matter what.</li>
      <li>Don’t badmouth: Assign responsibility, not blame. Say nothing of another you wouldn’t say to <!-- this said "him" but I changed it to "them" -->them.</li>
      <li>Never assume the motives of others are, to them, less noble than yours are to you. Expand your sense of the possible.</li>
      <li>Don’t trouble yourself with matters you truly cannot change. Expect no more of anyone than you can deliver yourself.</li>
      <li>Tolerate ambiguity. Laugh at yourself frequently.</li>
      <li>Concern yourself with what is right rather than who is right. Never forget that, no matter how certain, you might be wrong.</li>
      <li>Give up blood sports. Remember that your life belongs to others as well. Don’t risk it frivolously.</li>
      <li>Never lie to anyone for any reason. (Lies of omission are sometimes exempt.) Learn the needs of those around you and respect them.</li>
      <li>Avoid the pursuit of happiness. Seek to define your mission and pursue that. accentuce your use of the first personal pronoun.</li>
      <li>Praise at least as often as you disparage. Admit your errors freely and soon.</li>
      <li>Become less suspicious of joy. Understand humility.</li>
      <li>Remember that love forgives everything. Foster dignity.</li>
      <li>Live memorably. Love yourself.</li>
      <li>Endure.</li>
      <li>John Barlow 1977</li>
